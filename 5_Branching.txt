Branching in Git : A branch in git is a pointer to snapshot of our changes.When you create a branch, you are
                   creating a new line of development that you can commit changes to independently of the
                   main project.The 'main' or 'master' branch is typically default branch in a repository.

Basic Branch Operations :

        a) Creating a branch : Use 'git branch <branch-name>' to create a new branch.
        b) Switching Branches : Use 'git checkout <branch-name>' or newer 'git switch <branch-name>'
                                to move to different branches.
        c) Creating and switching : Use 'git checkout -b <branch-name> or newer 'git switch -c 
                                    <branch-name>' to create a new branch and switch to it
                                    immediately.
        d) Merging Branches : Use 'git merge <branch-name>' to merge changes from one branch to
                              another branch.
        e) Deleting Branches : Use 'git branch -d <branch-name>' to delete a branch.
