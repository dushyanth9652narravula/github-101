Git : 

   1) Git is a version control system whch allows us to track the code changes in our project.
   2) Through git u can get the following advantages :

        a) You can version ur code that means u have the history of code changes.
        b) You can easily revert back to ur previous code easily. Because u have history of changes.
        c) You can compare the latest version of ur code with the fresly made features.
        d) We can use git for context switching. Let's say u are working for new feature  and ur previous 
           version is in production and it has some bug, then u can save current version and go back for
           previous version and fix that bug and then revert back to current version.

        e) Through git u can make code review for all of ur teamates.


Github :


    1) Github is web hosting service for git repositories. It is a cloub base storage service.
    2) Through github u can maintain backup of ur code. 
    3) Through github itself u can share ur code with others (That means other teammates)


The main difference between git and github is :

    1) Git is command line interface (Software). Github is a web-based service.
    2) Git is used for tracking code changes. Github is used for hosting git repositories. And Github 
       provides web interface tto view chnages in files.
    3) We can use git without github. But we cannot use github without git.
    4) If u are doing ur project alone and don't want to collaborate with others then u can use git only.
       Otherwise u can use both git and github.
